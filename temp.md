# The Last Light

When the town's lanterns failed one autumn night, Mara climbed the hill with a single match and a jar of oil. She did not know why the lamps had gone dark — the elders shrugged, the clocks kept time — but she felt the absence like a missing word in a sentence.

At the crest, she struck the match and touched flame to the wick. Light spilled into the glass like a small sun. It warmed the damp stones, the metal rails, and a sleeping cat on the steps. Neighbors pressed their faces to windows, watching as one lamp became two, then a scattered constellation along the winding road.

People stepped outside, carrying their own flasks and candles. They walked toward each other, trading soft stories and borrowed light. Under the steady glow, Mara realized the lamps had not been lost; they'd been waiting for someone to begin again. The night, once empty, became a place to speak, to remember, and to make room for morning.
